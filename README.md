#Open-source data repository for everything

The main idea behind this project is - to create "swiss army knife" of data for large projects. 

Even smallest contribution will be priceless for this project's growth. So please, don't hesitate to actively take part in development process, to check and fix any wrong information!

Additionally, for contributors I added, whole database's dump where all tables connected to each other with foreign keys. That makes possible to see whole scene and work efficiently.
